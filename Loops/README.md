# Dart Loops
#### Loops are used to run a block of code continuously until the matches a specified condition ####

# Loop Types
* for loop
* for...in loop
* while loop
* do-while loop

## [for loop](https://github.com/kadelcode/dart_codes/blob/main/Loops/for_loop.dart)
- The for loop is used when we know the number of iteration in advance
- ### Syntax
	```
	for (initialization; condition; increament/decrement) {
		// block of code to be executed
	}
	```

## [for...in loop](https://github.com/kadelcode/dart_codes/blob/main/Loops/for_in_loop.dart)
- The for...in loop iterates over elements in an iterable(sequence)
- ### Syntax
	```
	for ( var i in object\sequence) {
		// block of code to be executed
	}
	```

## [while loop](https://github.com/kadelcode/dart_codes/blob/main/Loops/while_loop.dart)
- The while loop executes a block of code until the given test condition is false
- ### Syntax
	```
	while(condition) {
		// code to be executed provided the condition is true
	}
	```

## [do-while loop]
- It's similar to the while loop but first executes the loop statement and then check for the test condition
- ### Syntax
	```
	do {
		// loop body
	}while(condition);
	```
