	```
	for (initialization; condition; increament/decrement) {
		// block of code to be executed
	}
	```

## [for...in loop](https://github.com/kadelcode/dart_codes/blob/main/Loops/for_in_loop.dart)
- The for...in loop iterates over elements in an iterable(sequence)
- ### Syntax
	```
	for ( var i in object\sequence) {
		// block of code to be executed
	}
	```
