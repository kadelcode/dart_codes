# Dart Variable
- A variable is a memory location used to store a value
- All variables must be declared before they are used
- The var keyword is used to declare a variable in Dart

# Rules to create a variable
- The first character of a variable should only be an alphabet
- Variables can't contain special characters like keywords, unicode characters, runes...
- A variable shouldn't a whitespace
- Variables are case-sensitive

# Type Annotations
- Explicitly adding the type of value in which a variable can hold
    - Syntax: <var_type> <var_name>

# Final & Const Keyword
-  The final and const keyword are used if we don't want a variable value to be altered. They create constants and objects that are immutable
- final keyword is a runtime constant, its value can be assigned at runtime.
- const keyword is used to create compile time constants.
- We can declare a value to compile-time constant such as number, string literal, a constant variable...
